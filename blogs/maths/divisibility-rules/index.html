    <h1>Mastering Divisibility Rules: Quick Mental Math Tricks for Numbers 1-10</h1>
    
    <p>Divisibility rules are powerful shortcuts that help us determine whether one number can be divided by another without performing the actual division. These mathematical techniques are essential tools for number theory, mental math, factorization, finding LCM/HCF, and modular arithmetic. Whether you're a student preparing for competitive exams or someone looking to sharpen their mathematical skills, understanding these rules will significantly speed up your calculations.</p>

    <h2>Why Divisibility Rules Matter</h2>
    
    <p>Before diving into the specific rules, it's important to understand why these shortcuts are so valuable. Divisibility rules save time, reduce computational errors, and build number sense that's crucial for advanced mathematics. They're particularly useful in algebra, cryptography, computer science, and various real-world applications where quick mental calculations make a difference.</p>

    <h2>Divisibility by 1</h2>
    
    <p>This is the simplest rule of all: every integer is divisible by 1. This fundamental property forms the basis of number theory and serves as a starting point for understanding more complex divisibility concepts.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> 45 ÷ 1 = 45 and -7 ÷ 1 = -7. Any number, whether positive or negative, is perfectly divisible by 1.</p>

    <h2>Divisibility by 2</h2>
    
    <p>A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. This rule works because 10 is divisible by 2, so any multiple of 10 is also divisible by 2, meaning only the last digit matters.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>124 → last digit is 4 → divisible by 2</li>
      <li>907 → last digit is 7 → not divisible by 2</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 3</h2>
    
    <p>If the sum of all digits in a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. This elegant rule works because of how our decimal system relates to multiples of 3.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>213 → 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 → 6 is divisible by 3 → 213 is divisible by 3</li>
      <li>145 → 1 + 4 + 5 = 10 → 10 is not divisible by 3 → 145 is not divisible by 3</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 4</h2>
    
    <p>A number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. Since 100 is divisible by 4, we only need to check the last two digits of any number to determine divisibility by 4.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>2316 → last two digits = 16 → 16 ÷ 4 = 4 → divisible by 4</li>
      <li>5892 → last two digits = 92 → 92 ÷ 4 = 23 → divisible by 4</li>
      <li>847 → last two digits = 47 → 47 is not divisible by 4 → not divisible by 4</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 5</h2>
    
    <p>The rule for 5 is straightforward: a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is either 0 or 5.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>890 → last digit is 0 → divisible by 5</li>
      <li>1235 → last digit is 5 → divisible by 5</li>
      <li>847 → last digit is 7 → not divisible by 5</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 6</h2>
    
    <p>A number is divisible by 6 if it satisfies both the divisibility rules for 2 and 3. Since 6 = 2 × 3, a number must be even and have a digit sum divisible by 3.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>246 → even number ✓, digit sum = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 (divisible by 3) ✓ → divisible by 6</li>
      <li>135 → odd number ✗, digit sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (divisible by 3) ✓ → not divisible by 6</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 7</h2>
    
    <p>This rule is slightly more complex: double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> For 203:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last digit is 3, double it: 3 × 2 = 6</li>
      <li>Remaining number: 20</li>
      <li>Subtract: 20 - 6 = 14</li>
      <li>14 is divisible by 7, so 203 is divisible by 7</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 8</h2>
    
    <p>If the last three digits of a number form a number divisible by 8, then the entire number is divisible by 8. This works because 1000 is divisible by 8.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>4560 → last three digits = 560 → 560 ÷ 8 = 70 → divisible by 8</li>
      <li>1234 → last three digits = 234 → 234 is not divisible by 8 → not divisible by 8</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 9</h2>
    
    <p>Similar to the rule for 3, if the sum of all digits is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>729 → 7 + 2 + 9 = 18 → 18 is divisible by 9 → divisible by 9</li>
      <li>546 → 5 + 4 + 6 = 15 → 15 is not divisible by 9 → not divisible by 9</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Divisibility by 10</h2>
    
    <p>A number is divisible by 10 if and only if its last digit is 0. This is one of the easiest rules to remember and apply.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>150 → last digit is 0 → divisible by 10</li>
      <li>281 → last digit is 1 → not divisible by 10</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Problems</h2>
    
    <p>Let's apply these rules to some practical problems:</p>

    <h3>Problem 1: Multiple Divisibility</h3>
    <p>Is 7248 divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Divisibility by 2: Last digit is 8 (even) → Yes</li>
      <li>Divisibility by 3: 7 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 21, which is divisible by 3 → Yes</li>
      <li>Divisibility by 4: Last two digits = 48, and 48 ÷ 4 = 12 → Yes</li>
      <li>Divisibility by 6: Divisible by both 2 and 3 → Yes</li>
      <li>Divisibility by 8: Last three digits = 248, and 248 ÷ 8 = 31 → Yes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem 2: Finding the Smallest Number</h3>
    <p>Find the smallest number that is divisible by 2, 3, and 5.</p>
    <p>The smallest such number is the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of 2, 3, and 5, which is 30. We can verify: 30 has a last digit of 0 (divisible by 2 and 5), and 3 + 0 = 3 (divisible by 3).</p>

    <h3>Problem 3: Checking Large Numbers</h3>
    <p>Is 94,343 divisible by 7?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Last digit: 3, double it = 6</li>
      <li>Remaining number: 9434</li>
      <li>Subtract: 9434 - 6 = 9428</li>
      <li>Apply the rule again: 9428 → 942 - 16 = 926</li>
      <li>Continue: 926 → 92 - 12 = 80</li>
      <li>80 is not divisible by 7, so 94,343 is not divisible by 7</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    
    <p>When applying divisibility rules, students often make several common errors. For divisibility by 3 and 9, remember to add all digits, not just select ones. For divisibility by 4 and 8, only the last two or three digits matter respectively, not the entire number. When checking divisibility by 6, both conditions must be satisfied, not just one.</p>

    <h2>Advanced Applications</h2>
    
    <p>Divisibility rules extend far beyond simple arithmetic. In computer science, these rules help optimize algorithms for prime factorization and modular arithmetic operations. In cryptography, understanding divisibility is crucial for RSA encryption and other security protocols. Number theorists use these rules to explore patterns in prime numbers and solve complex Diophantine equations.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Mastering Divisibility Rules</h2>
    
    <p>Practice is the key to mastering these rules. Start with smaller numbers and gradually work your way up to larger ones. Create flashcards with numbers and test yourself regularly. Try to identify patterns in everyday numbers like phone numbers, addresses, or prices. The more you practice, the more automatic these mental shortcuts become.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    
    <p>Divisibility rules are essential mathematical tools that make calculations faster and more efficient. By mastering these simple shortcuts for numbers 1 through 10, you'll build a strong foundation for more advanced mathematical concepts. Whether you're solving homework problems, preparing for competitive exams, or just want to improve your mental math skills, these rules will serve you well throughout your mathematical journey.</p>

    <p>Remember, mathematics is not about memorization alone – it's about understanding patterns and developing intuition. As you practice these divisibility rules, you'll start to see the elegant patterns that make mathematics so beautiful and practical.</p>
