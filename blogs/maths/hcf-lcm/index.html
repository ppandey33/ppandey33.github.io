    <h1>HCF and LCM: Complete Guide with Methods and Examples</h1>
    
    <p>Understanding the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) is fundamental to number theory and has practical applications ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced algorithms in computer science. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the concepts, calculation methods, and real-world applications of these important mathematical tools.</p>

    <h2>What Are HCF and LCM?</h2>
    
    <h3>Highest Common Factor (HCF)</h3>
    
    <p>The Highest Common Factor, also known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), is the largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly without leaving a remainder. In other words, it's the greatest number that is a factor of all the given numbers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> HCF is the largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly.</p>
    
    <h3>Least Common Multiple (LCM)</h3>
    
    <p>The Least Common Multiple is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. It's the smallest number that all the given numbers can divide into exactly.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.</p>

    <h2>Methods to Calculate HCF and LCM</h2>
    
    <p>There are three primary methods to find HCF and LCM. Each method has its advantages depending on the size and nature of the numbers involved.</p>

    <h3>Method 1: Prime Factorization Method</h3>
    
    <p>This is one of the most reliable and systematic methods for finding both HCF and LCM. Let's see how it works with an example of finding HCF and LCM of 24 and 36.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Step 1: Find Prime Factors</strong></p>
    
    <p>First, express each number as a product of prime factors:</p>
    
    <pre><code>24 = 2³ × 3
36 = 2² × 3²</code></pre>
    
    <p><strong>Step 2: Calculate HCF</strong></p>
    
    <p>For HCF, take the lowest power of all common prime factors:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Common primes: 2 and 3
Lowest powers: 2² and 3¹
HCF = 2² × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12</code></pre>
    
    <p><strong>Step 3: Calculate LCM</strong></p>
    
    <p>For LCM, take the highest power of all prime factors present in either number:</p>
    
    <pre><code>All primes: 2 and 3
Highest powers: 2³ and 3²
LCM = 2³ × 3² = 8 × 9 = 72</code></pre>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Key Rule:</strong> For HCF, use the lowest powers of common primes. For LCM, use the highest powers of all primes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Method 2: Division Method (Listing Factors)</h3>
    
    <p>This method involves systematically dividing the numbers and finding common factors. Let's find the HCF and LCM of 12 and 18 using this approach.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Finding HCF:</strong></p>
    
    <pre><code>Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Common factors: 1, 2, 3, 6
HCF = 6 (highest common factor)</code></pre>
    
    <p><strong>Finding LCM:</strong></p>
    
    <pre><code>Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 54...
Multiples of 18: 18, 36, 54, 72...
Common multiples: 36, 54...
LCM = 36 (least common multiple)</code></pre>

    <h3>Method 3: Euclid's Algorithm (For HCF/GCD)</h3>
    
    <p>Euclid's Algorithm is an advanced but highly efficient method for finding the GCD (HCF) of two numbers, especially useful for large numbers. This method uses division repeatedly until the remainder becomes zero.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example: Finding GCD of 252 and 105</strong></p>
    
    <pre><code>Step 1: 252 = 105 × 2 + 42
Step 2: 105 = 42 × 2 + 21
Step 3: 42 = 21 × 2 + 0

GCD = 21 (the last non-zero remainder)</code></pre>
    
    <p>The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Why Euclid's Algorithm?</strong> This method is particularly efficient for large numbers where prime factorization would be time-consuming. It's widely used in computer algorithms and cryptography.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The Shortcut Formula</h2>
    
    <p>There's a beautiful relationship between HCF and LCM that provides a quick way to find one if you know the other:</p>
    
    <pre><code>HCF × LCM = Product of the two numbers
HCF × LCM = a × b</code></pre>
    
    <p><strong>Example: For numbers 12 and 18</strong></p>
    
    <pre><code>We know: HCF = 6
Using formula: LCM = (12 × 18) ÷ 6 = 216 ÷ 6 = 36</code></pre>
    
    <p>This relationship is extremely useful when you've calculated one value and need to find the other quickly.</p>

    <h2>Special Cases and Properties</h2>
    
    <h3>Co-Prime Numbers</h3>
    
    <p>When two numbers are co-prime (share no common factors except 1), their relationship becomes particularly simple:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Example: 15 and 20 (co-prime)
HCF = 1
LCM = 15 × 20 = 120</code></pre>
    
    <p>For co-prime numbers, the HCF is always 1, and the LCM is simply the product of the two numbers.</p>
    
    <h3>Important Properties</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The HCF of two numbers is always less than or equal to the smaller number</li>
      <li>The LCM of two numbers is always greater than or equal to the larger number</li>
      <li>HCF divides both the numbers exactly</li>
      <li>Both numbers divide the LCM exactly</li>
      <li>For any two numbers a and b: HCF(a,b) × LCM(a,b) = a × b</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
    
    <h3>In Everyday Life</h3>
    
    <p>HCF and LCM have numerous practical applications:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scheduling:</strong> Finding when events will coincide (LCM) - if bus A arrives every 12 minutes and bus B every 18 minutes, they'll arrive together every 36 minutes</li>
      <li><strong>Dividing items equally:</strong> Distributing items into equal groups (HCF) - dividing 24 apples and 36 oranges into identical gift baskets</li>
      <li><strong>Music and rhythm:</strong> Finding when different musical patterns will align</li>
      <li><strong>Gear ratios:</strong> Calculating when gears with different teeth will align</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>In Computer Science and Programming</h3>
    
    <p>HCF/GCD algorithms are fundamental in:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cryptography:</strong> RSA encryption relies heavily on GCD calculations</li>
      <li><strong>Fraction simplification:</strong> Reducing fractions to lowest terms</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithm optimization:</strong> Many algorithms use GCD for efficiency</li>
      <li><strong>Graphics programming:</strong> Aspect ratio calculations and pixel-perfect scaling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Practice Problems with Solutions</h2>
    
    <h3>Problem 1: Basic Calculation</h3>
    
    <p>Find the HCF and LCM of 16 and 24.</p>
    
    <pre><code>Prime Factorization:
16 = 2⁴
24 = 2³ × 3

HCF = 2³ = 8 (lowest power of common prime)
LCM = 2⁴ × 3 = 16 × 3 = 48 (highest power of all primes)</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Problem 2: Using the Formula</h3>
    
    <p>If HCF of two numbers is 8 and their product is 384, find their LCM.</p>
    
    <pre><code>Using: HCF × LCM = Product
8 × LCM = 384
LCM = 384 ÷ 8 = 48</code></pre>
    
    <h3>Problem 3: Three Numbers</h3>
    
    <p>Find the LCM of 12, 15, and 20.</p>
    
    <pre><code>Prime Factorization:
12 = 2² × 3
15 = 3 × 5
20 = 2² × 5

LCM = 2² × 3 × 5 = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60</code></pre>

    <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Confusing HCF and LCM:</strong> Remember HCF is the largest common factor (smaller value), while LCM is the smallest common multiple (larger value)</li>
      <li><strong>Missing prime factors:</strong> Always ensure you've found all prime factors in the factorization method</li>
      <li><strong>Using wrong powers:</strong> For HCF use minimum powers, for LCM use maximum powers</li>
      <li><strong>Forgetting uncommon primes:</strong> When finding LCM, include all prime factors from both numbers</li>
    </ul>
