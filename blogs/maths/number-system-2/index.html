    <h2>1. Even and Odd Numbers: Parity Matters</h2>

    <h3>Even Numbers: Divisible by Two</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A number is even if it can be divided by 2 with no remainder.</p>

    <p><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> n = 2k where k ∈ Z</p>

    <p><strong>Set:</strong> {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...}</p>

    <pre><code>Properties:
• Always ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8
• Even ± Even = Even  (4 + 6 = 10)
• Even × Any = Even   (4 × 7 = 28)
• 0 is even (0 = 2 × 0)</code></pre>

    <h3>Odd Numbers: Not Divisible by Two</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A number is odd if dividing by 2 leaves a remainder of 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Mathematical Form:</strong> n = 2k + 1 where k ∈ Z</p>

    <p><strong>Set:</strong> {..., -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...}</p>

    <pre><code>Properties:
• Always ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9
• Odd ± Odd = Even    (5 + 7 = 12)
• Odd + Even = Odd    (5 + 6 = 11)
• Odd × Odd = Odd     (5 × 7 = 35)
• Odd × Even = Even   (5 × 6 = 30)</code></pre>

    <h4>Applications in Computing & AI</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bit Manipulation:</strong> LSB (Least Significant Bit) determines parity</li>
      <li><strong>Hashing:</strong> Even/odd hash buckets for load balancing</li>
      <li><strong>Error Detection:</strong> Parity bits in data transmission</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithm Optimization:</strong> Different strategies for even/odd cases</li>
      <li><strong>Image Processing:</strong> Checkerboard patterns, pixel alternation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Prime Numbers: The Atoms of Mathematics</h2>

    <h3>Definition and Fundamental Properties</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.</p>

    <p><strong>First 20 Primes:</strong> 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71</p>

    <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> 2 is the only even prime number!</p>

    <pre><code>Why is 1 NOT Prime?
• Primes must have EXACTLY 2 factors
• 1 only has 1 factor (itself)
• Historical: Including 1 breaks fundamental theorem of arithmetic

Why is 2 the Only Even Prime?
• All other even numbers divisible by 2
• 2 is divisible only by 1 and 2
• All other primes must be odd

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:
Every integer > 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of primes
Example: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5 (unique prime factorization)</code></pre>

    <h3>Testing for Primality</h3>

    <pre><code>Method 1: Trial Division (Simple)
Check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to √n

Example: Is 29 prime?
√29 ≈ 5.38
Test: 29 ÷ 2 = 14.5 ✗
      29 ÷ 3 = 9.67 ✗
      29 ÷ 5 = 5.8  ✗
No divisors found → 29 is prime!</code></pre>

    <h3>Prime Number Theorems and Patterns</h3>

    <p><strong>Prime Number Theorem:</strong> The number of primes less than n is approximately n/ln(n)</p>

    <p><strong>Goldbach's Conjecture (unproven):</strong> Every even integer > 2 can be expressed as sum of two primes</p>

    <p>Example: 10 = 3 + 7, 20 = 3 + 17, 100 = 47 + 53</p>

    <pre><code>Special Prime Categories:

Twin Primes: Primes differing by 2
• (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31)

Mersenne Primes: Form 2^p - 1
• M₂ = 2² - 1 = 3
• M₃ = 2³ - 1 = 7
• M₅ = 2⁵ - 1 = 31
• Used to find largest known primes!

Sophie Germain Primes: p and 2p+1 are both prime
• 2: 2×2+1 = 5 (both prime)
• 3: 2×3+1 = 7 (both prime)
• 11: 2×11+1 = 23 (both prime)</code></pre>

    <h3>Cryptography: Primes Secure the Internet</h3>

    <p>
      RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is the most widely used public-key cryptography system. It relies on the fact that multiplying two large primes is easy, but factoring their product back into primes
      is extremely difficult.
    </p>

    <pre><code>RSA Algorithm Basics:

1. Choose two large primes: p and q
   Example: p = 61, q = 53

2. Compute n = p × q
   n = 61 × 53 = 3233

3. Compute φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
   φ(3233) = 60 × 52 = 3120

4. Choose public exponent e (coprime to φ(n))
   e = 17

5. Compute private key d
   d × e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n))
   d = 2753

Public Key: (n, e) = (3233, 17)
Private Key: (n, d) = (3233, 2753)

Security: Factoring large numbers is extremely difficult
Real-world RSA uses 2048 or 4096-bit primes!</code></pre>

    <h4>Primes in AI and Machine Learning</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hash Functions:</strong> Prime numbers reduce collisions in hash tables</li>
      <li><strong>Random Number Generation:</strong> Prime-based algorithms for better randomness</li>
      <li><strong>Bloom Filters:</strong> Prime-sized arrays for probabilistic data structures</li>
      <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Prime number patterns as features</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Multi-Party Computation:</strong> Privacy-preserving ML</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Composite Numbers: The Opposite of Primes</h2>

    <h3>Definition and Properties</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20...</p>

    <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Every composite number can be expressed as a product of primes</p>

    <pre><code>Understanding Composite Numbers:

4 = 2 × 2 = 2²
Factors: 1, 2, 4 (3 factors)

12 = 2² × 3
Factors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 (6 factors)

Number Classification:
• 1: Neither prime nor composite (unit)
• 2: Prime
• 3: Prime
• 4: Composite
• 5: Prime
• 6: Composite</code></pre>

    <h3>Prime Factorization</h3>

    <pre><code>Finding Prime Factorization:

Example: 60
60 ÷ 2 = 30
30 ÷ 2 = 15
15 ÷ 3 = 5
5 ÷ 5 = 1

Prime factorization: 60 = 2² × 3 × 5

Example: 1001
1001 ÷ 7 = 143
143 ÷ 11 = 13
13 ÷ 13 = 1

Prime factorization: 1001 = 7 × 11 × 13</code></pre>

    <h2>4. Co-Prime Numbers (Relatively Prime)</h2>

    <h3>Definition and Importance</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two numbers are co-prime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1.</p>

    <p><strong>Notation:</strong> gcd(a, b) = 1</p>

    <p><strong>Key Fact:</strong> Co-prime numbers share no common prime factors</p>

    <pre><code>Understanding Co-Prime Numbers:

Example 1: 8 and 15
Factors of 8:  1, 2, 4, 8
Factors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
Common factor: Only 1
gcd(8, 15) = 1 → Co-prime! ✓

Example 2: 8 and 12
Factors of 8:  1, 2, 4, 8
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Common factors: 1, 2, 4
gcd(8, 12) = 4 → NOT co-prime ✗

Important: Co-prime ≠ Both prime
• 8 and 15 are co-prime (neither is prime)
• 15 and 25 are NOT co-prime (both share factor 5)</code></pre>

    <h3>Finding GCD: Euclidean Algorithm</h3>

    <pre><code>Euclidean Algorithm (Efficient GCD):

gcd(48, 18):
48 = 2 × 18 + 12
18 = 1 × 12 + 6
12 = 2 × 6 + 0
→ gcd(48, 18) = 6

Algorithm:
while b ≠ 0:
    temp = b
    b = a mod b
    a = temp
return a</code></pre>

    <h4>Co-Primes in Cryptography</h4>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>RSA Key Generation:</strong> e and φ(n) must be coprime</li>
      <li><strong>Modular Arithmetic:</strong> Coprime numbers enable modular inverses</li>
      <li><strong>Chinese Remainder Theorem:</strong> Requires pairwise coprime moduli</li>
      <li><strong>Diffie-Hellman:</strong> Uses coprime properties for key exchange</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Perfect Numbers: Sum of Divisors</h2>

    <h3>Definition and History</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A perfect number equals the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).</p>

    <p><strong>Known Perfect Numbers:</strong> 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336...</p>

    <p><strong>Historical Note:</strong> Known to ancient Greeks, considered mystical</p>

    <pre><code>Understanding Perfect Numbers:

6 is Perfect:
Divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
Proper divisors: 1, 2, 3 (exclude 6)
Sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 ✓

28 is Perfect:
Divisors of 28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28
Proper divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14
Sum: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28 ✓

Euclid-Euler Theorem:
If 2^p - 1 is prime (Mersenne prime), 
then 2^(p-1) × (2^p - 1) is perfect

Example: p = 3
2^3 - 1 = 7 (prime)
Perfect number = 2² × 7 = 28 ✓</code></pre>

    <h3>Related: Abundant and Deficient Numbers</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Perfect:</strong> σ(n) = n (e.g., 6, 28)</li>
      <li><strong>Abundant:</strong> σ(n) > n (e.g., 12: 1+2+3+4+6 = 16 > 12)</li>
      <li><strong>Deficient:</strong> σ(n) < n (e.g., 8: 1+2+4 = 7 < 8)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Amicable Numbers: Friendly Pairs</h2>

    <h3>Definition and Properties</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Two numbers are amicable if each equals the sum of the other's proper divisors.</p>

    <p><strong>First Pair:</strong> (220, 284) - discovered by Pythagoras</p>

    <pre><code>Amicable Pair: (220, 284)

Proper divisors of 220:
1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110
Sum = 284 ✓

Proper divisors of 284:
1, 2, 4, 71, 142
Sum = 220 ✓

Each number equals the sum of the other's divisors!

Other Amicable Pairs:
(1184, 1210)
(2620, 2924)
(5020, 5564)</code></pre>

    <h2>7. Harshad Numbers (Niven Numbers)</h2>

    <h3>Definition and Patterns</h3>

    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A number divisible by the sum of its digits.</p>

    <p><strong>Etymology:</strong> "Harshad" from Sanskrit meaning "joy-giver"</p>

    <pre><code>Understanding Harshad Numbers:

Digits: 1, 8
Sum: 1 + 8 = 9
18 ÷ 9 = 2 ✓ (divisible)

21 is Harshad:
Digits: 2, 1
Sum: 2 + 1 = 3
21 ÷ 3 = 7 ✓

23 is NOT Harshad:
Digits: 2, 3
